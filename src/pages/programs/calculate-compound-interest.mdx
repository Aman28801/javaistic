Title = To Calculate Compound Interest
Description = This code takes the principal amount, annual interest rate (as a percentage),
            number of years, and compounding frequency (how many times per year the interest is compounded) 
            as input from the user.

##Java Code

import java.util.Scanner;

public class CompoundInterestCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Input principal amount
        System.out.print("Enter the principal amount: ");
        double principal = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Input annual interest rate (as a percentage)
        System.out.print("Enter the annual interest rate (as a percentage): ");
        double annualRate = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Input number of years
        System.out.print("Enter the number of years: ");
        int years = scanner.nextInt();

        // Input number of times interest is compounded per year
        System.out.print("Enter the number of times interest is compounded per year: ");
        int compoundingFrequency = scanner.nextInt();

        // Convert annual rate to decimal and calculate compound interest
        double rate = annualRate / 100;
        double amount = principal * Math.pow(1 + (rate / compoundingFrequency), compoundingFrequency * years);

        // Calculate compound interest
        double compoundInterest = amount - principal;

        // Display the result
        System.out.println("The compound interest after " + years + " years is: " + compoundInterest);
        
        // Close the scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}
